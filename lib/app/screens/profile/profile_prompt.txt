based on this user model, write a flutter code, write a user profile screen where user can upload profile image with camera and gallery & two button in a row, (change, delete). use firebase to get and post the data
Here's an example Flutter code for a user profile screen that allows the user to upload a profile image from the camera or gallery using Firebase. The screen also displays the user's profile information and provides options to edit or delete the profile picture.

Note that you will need to integrate Firebase in your project and replace the Firebase API keys and URLs with your own.
